Compendiums for genesys (Star Wars FFG system for Foundry VTT)
<h1>What is it?</h1>
This is suppose to be a compendium pack that provide small help for GM's who runs Genesys games using <a href="https://github.com/StarWarsFoundryVTT/StarWarsFFG">StarWarsFFG</a> system in Foundry VTT.
<h1>What is here?</h1>
For now there is only critical injuries compendium and core archetypes.
You can use critical injuries compendium to create rollable table. It can be done by changed macros, that is included into GenesysMacros compendium. After that you can use critical roll macros from <a href="https://github.com/StarWarsFoundryVTT/StarWarsFFG/wiki/Creating-Critical-Tables#add-the-critical-roll-macro">here</a>.
<h2>Item qualities compendium</h2>
You can drag and drop items from this compendium to an item qualities section. Also I must warn you, that upgrading a level of quality would not upgrade a modifire. So you will need to change it inside a concrete item.
For 1.4 version of s System there is an opportunity to auto upgrade modifiers, it you create <i>an item attachment</i>. You can add twice same item quality and activate it in <i>Add Mods</i> section.
